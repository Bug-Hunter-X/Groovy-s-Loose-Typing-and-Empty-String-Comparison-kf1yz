# Groovy's Loose Typing and Empty String Comparison
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to its loose typing and how it affects the comparison of empty strings with null values.

## The Bug
Groovy's loose typing allows for comparisons between different types without explicit type casting, but this can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing strings, especially when an empty string is compared with a null value.
In Java, `"" == null` would evaluate to `false`. However, in Groovy, it evaluates to `true` because Groovy performs a loose type comparison, treating an empty string as equivalent to null in certain contexts. This behavior can cause unexpected results in conditional logic.

## Reproducing the Bug
The `bug.groovy` file demonstrates this behavior. The `myMethod` function tries to handle null or empty input gracefully, but because Groovy treats `"" == null` as `true`, the empty string condition is never reached. This behavior is different from what one might expect from Java or other strongly-typed languages.

## Solution
The solution provided in `bugSolution.groovy` addresses this problem by explicitly checking for null and then for emptiness, ensuring that both conditions are handled independently. This way the intended logic is followed without any ambiguity related to Groovy's loose typing.
